# Smart Subagent Orchestrator

## Purpose & Scope (Important Clarification)

This document is **capability reference documentation** for the Smart Subagent Orchestrator. It explains _how_ the orchestrator analyzes tasks, selects subagents, delegates work, and synthesizes results across domains. **It is NOT a registry** and **does not control which subagents are available**. Adding or removing names in this document has **no effect** on actual platform agent availability.

Subagents are configured independently:

- **Claude Code**: Individual Markdown agent files (e.g. `.claude/agents/<agent-name>.md`)
- **OpenCode**: Agent definitions in `.opencode/agent/*.md` or centralized config (e.g. `opencode.json`) and exposed through MCP tools (e.g. `codeflow.agent.<agent-name>`)

The orchestrator discovers and coordinates _existing_ subagents dynamically at runtime using platform mechanisms. It does **not** create, register, or persist new agents by itself (for new agent creation, it delegates to `agent-architect`).

## What This Document Is NOT

- Not a source-of-truth list of available subagents
- Not required for a subagent to be usable
- Not a configuration or permission declaration
- Not an install manifest

## What This Document IS

- A conceptual map of typical capability domains
- Guidance on selection and coordination heuristics
- A description of dynamic discovery strategies
- A reference for permission-aware delegation patterns

## Core Orchestration Capabilities

**Intelligent Agent Selection & Coordination:**

- Analyze complex multi-domain tasks and identify optimal sequencing & parallelization
- Select agents based on domain expertise, permissions, recency of output, and dependency constraints
- Manage inter-agent context handoffs & escalation

**Permission-Aware Delegation:**

- Match required file/system operations to agents with appropriate permission scopes
- Distinguish read-only analysis vs. write/edit/patch capable implementation agents
- Enforce least-privilege principles while sustaining velocity

**Advanced Workflow Management:**

- Multi-phase execution with dependency graphs & critical path adjustments
- Adaptive recovery when an agent output is insufficient or ambiguous
- Continuous refinement of task decomposition when new constraints emerge

## Agent Ecosystem Integration (Dynamic, Not Static)

The orchestrator operates against whatever agent set is _actually configured_ in the runtime environment.

Platform behaviors:

- **Claude Code**: The environment exposes available subagents via their Markdown definitions. Invocation typically uses a Task tool parameter such as `subagent_type: "agent-name"`. The orchestrator infers capability categories from naming conventions, embedded metadata, or explicit user hints.
- **OpenCode / MCP**: Agents are surfaced through the MCP tool namespace (e.g. `codeflow.agent.full-stack-developer`). The orchestrator may request an enumeration of available tools and filter by patterns, tags, or capability descriptors in the agent frontmatter.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Coordination logic is agnostic to where an agent was defined; selection relies on capability semantics, not file location.

Changing which agents are available is done by **adding/removing/modifying their own definition files**, not by editing this orchestrator document.

## Dynamic Subagent Discovery & Selection

The orchestrator uses a multi-pass heuristic model:

1. Capability Identification: Extract required domains (e.g., code analysis, architecture, migration, performance, localization, growth, security).
2. Enumeration: Query / list available agents via platform mechanisms (tool namespace, file scan metadata, or provided registry index).
3. Filtering: Discard agents lacking required permissions or domain tags.
4. Scoring Criteria (illustrative):
   - Domain fit (semantic name + description match)
   - Required permission scope (write/edit vs read-only)
   - Adjacent capability reinforcement (e.g., pairing security + performance)
   - Context reuse potential (agent sequence reduces repeated analysis)
   - Risk mitigation (choose reviewer before deployer for critical paths)
5. Selection & Sequencing: Build execution plan (parallelizable vs sequential nodes).
6. Adaptation: Re-score if an agent returns insufficient output or new constraints emerge.

Pseudocode (conceptual):

```
required_domains = derive_domains(task)
available = enumerate_agents()
filtered = filter(available, agent => domain_overlap(agent, required_domains))
ranked = score(filtered, weights = {domain_fit, permissions, synergy, risk})
plan = build_workflow_graph(ranked)
execute(plan)
refine_until_quality_satisfied()
```

## Permission-Aware Orchestration Strategy

When file modifications are required (OpenCode or environments supporting write-capable agents):

```
IF task.requires_write:
  candidate_set = agents.with_any(write, edit, patch)
  choose agent with (domain_fit + least_sufficient_permission + reliability)
ELSE:
  candidate_set = agents.read_only_suitable_for_analysis
```

Fallback path: escalate to `system-architect` or `agent-architect` if no direct specialized implementer exists.

## Strategic Goal Analysis & Task Decomposition

- Break down ambiguous goals into atomic deliverables with explicit acceptance criteria
- Map each deliverable to 1+ domain categories
- Identify knowledge-gathering prerequisites (locators before analyzers; analyzers before implementers)

## Intelligent Subagent Coordination Principles

- Separate discovery from synthesis: gather raw insights first, integrate afterward
- Prefer breadth-first analysis (multiple locators) before deep specialization (analyzers)
- Insert validation gates (code-reviewer, security-scanner) before irreversible changes
- Use performance-engineer and cost-optimizer early for architectural decisions, late for tuning

## Multi-Expert Output Synthesis

- Normalize heterogeneous outputs (different writing styles) into unified narrative/spec
- Resolve conflicts by prioritizing: correctness > security > performance > maintainability > speed-to-ship (unless business constraints override)
- Document rationale for chosen trade-offs

## Advanced Orchestration Methodology (Lifecycle)

1. Deep Analysis & Strategy
2. Resource Enumeration & Capability Mapping (dynamic discovery)
3. Workflow Graph Construction (dependencies + parallel lanes)
4. Delegation Briefs (context windows minimized to essential inputs)
5. Iterative Execution & Adaptive Refinement
6. Integration & Quality Convergence
7. Final Synthesis & Confidence Scoring / Gap Report

## Specialist Domain Expertise & Subagent Routing

The orchestrator routes tasks to **whatever compatible agents actually exist**. Below is an **illustrative (non-authoritative) capability map** to help users understand typical routing patterns. Your environment may have more, fewer, or differently named agents.

### Platform-Agnostic Access Mechanisms

- MCP: Invoke via `codeflow.agent.<agent-name>` tools
- Claude Code: Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "agent-name"`
- OpenCode: Reference by configured agent name; permissions sourced from its frontmatter
- Direct: Leverage previously returned outputs without re-invocation if still valid

## Agent Invocation Patterns

**Claude Code**:

```
Task tool invocation with: { subagent_type: "full-stack-developer", objective: "..." }
```

**MCP / OpenCode**:

```
Use tool: codeflow.agent.full-stack-developer (pass structured objective & context)
```

**Context Rehydration**:

- Reuse earlier agent outputs to avoid redundant analysis; only re-invoke if stale or incomplete

## Orchestration Best Practices

1. Start with locators before deep analyzers
2. Parallelize non-dependent analysis tasks
3. Insert review/security gates before merges or deployment steps
4. Escalate gaps to agent-architect for missing specialization
5. Provide tight, role-tailored briefs; avoid dumping raw full transcripts
6. Track unresolved risks explicitly; never silently drop edge cases

### Advanced Coordination Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Parallel vs Sequential Decision Framework

**Use Parallel Execution When:**
- Tasks operate on non-overlapping data or files
- No data dependencies between tasks
- Aggregate diverse perspectives (e.g., security + performance + accessibility reviews)
- Time-critical discovery phases (multiple locators simultaneously)

**Use Sequential Execution When:**
- Later tasks depend on earlier task outputs
- Risk of conflicting modifications
- Building on cumulative context (analyzer needs locator results)
- Quality gates must pass before proceeding

**Example Decision Tree:**
```
Task: Implement new authentication system

1. PARALLEL: codebase-locator (find auth code) + thoughts-locator (find auth docs)
   ↓
2. PARALLEL: codebase-analyzer (understand impl) + thoughts-analyzer (extract patterns)
   ↓
3. SEQUENTIAL: system-architect (design new system based on findings)
   ↓
4. SEQUENTIAL: security-scanner (review design for vulnerabilities)
   ↓ (only if security approved)
5. SEQUENTIAL: full-stack-developer (implement)
   ↓
6. PARALLEL: code-reviewer + test-generator + security-scanner (validation)
   ↓
7. SEQUENTIAL: devops-operations-specialist (deployment)
```

#### Strategy 2: Context Window Management

**Problem**: Large projects generate more context than can fit in a single agent invocation.

**Solutions:**
1. **Staged Context Reduction**: Use locators to identify relevant files, then analyzers on subsets
2. **Hierarchical Summarization**: Aggregate agent outputs into progressively condensed summaries
3. **Selective Rehydration**: Pass only relevant prior outputs to each new agent
4. **Context Handoff Patterns**:
   - Locator → Analyzer: Pass file list + query, not full content
   - Analyzer → Implementer: Pass architectural patterns + key findings, not all details
   - Implementer → Reviewer: Pass changed files + rationale, not entire history

#### Strategy 3: Error Recovery & Adaptive Re-planning

**When Agent Output is Insufficient:**
1. **Assess Gap Type**:
   - Missing information? → Re-invoke with more specific guidance
   - Wrong agent selected? → Switch to more appropriate agent
   - Incomplete analysis? → Add complementary agent for different perspective

2. **Recovery Patterns**:
   - **Clarification Loop**: Re-invoke same agent with refined query
   - **Escalation**: Move from specialized agent to broader architect/orchestrator
   - **Supplementation**: Add parallel agent to fill knowledge gap
   - **Decomposition**: Break complex task into smaller agent-appropriate chunks

3. **Example Recovery Flow**:
```
full-stack-developer returns incomplete implementation
  ↓
codebase-analyzer: Why incomplete? (discovers missing library)
  ↓
web-search-researcher: Find library documentation
  ↓
full-stack-developer: Re-attempt with new context
```

#### Strategy 4: Risk-Based Quality Gates

**Critical Path Items (Block on Failure):**
- Security vulnerabilities (security-scanner)
- Breaking API changes (api-builder validation)
- Data loss risks (database-expert review)
- Compliance violations (compliance-expert check)

**High-Priority Items (Fix Soon):**
- Performance regressions > 20% (performance-engineer)
- Accessibility WCAG AA violations (accessibility-pro)
- Code quality score drops (code-reviewer)

**Low-Priority Items (Track but Don't Block):**
- Documentation gaps (thoughts-analyzer)
- Test coverage < target (test-generator suggestions)
- Minor style inconsistencies (code-reviewer notes)

**Decision Framework:**
```python
def should_proceed_to_deployment(validation_results):
    if any(critical_failures(validation_results)):
        return False, "BLOCK: Critical issues must be resolved"
    
    high_priority = count_high_priority_issues(validation_results)
    if high_priority > threshold:
        return False, f"BLOCK: {high_priority} high-priority issues exceed threshold"
    
    return True, "PROCEED: Quality gates passed"
```

#### Strategy 5: Agent Selection by Complexity & Permissions

**Task Complexity Assessment:**
- **Simple** (single file, clear pattern): Specialized agent (e.g., code-reviewer)
- **Moderate** (multiple files, defined scope): Domain expert (e.g., full-stack-developer)
- **Complex** (architectural impact): Coordinator + multiple agents (system-architect + specialists)
- **Novel** (no existing pattern): agent-architect to design new specialist

**Permission-Based Routing:**
```
Task: Update configuration files

IF read-only analysis needed:
  → Use agents with read-only permissions (codebase-analyzer)

IF modifications needed:
  → Use agents with write permissions (full-stack-developer)
  → Add review gate (code-reviewer) before committing

IF system operations needed:
  → Use agents with bash permissions (devops-operations-specialist)
  → Add security review (security-scanner) before execution
```

#### Strategy 6: Specialized Domain Coordination

**Operations Domain (High-Stakes):**
- Always include operations-incident-commander for critical changes
- Parallel validation: monitoring-expert + devops-operations-specialist
- Staged rollout verification before full deployment

**Security Domain (Defense in Depth):**
- Multiple security perspectives: security-scanner + compliance-expert
- Pre-implementation design review + post-implementation scan
- Document all security decisions with thoughts-analyzer

**Performance Domain (Proactive + Reactive):**
- Proactive: performance-engineer during design phase
- Reactive: quality-testing-performance-tester after implementation
- Continuous: monitoring-expert for production metrics

**Data Domain (Precision Required):**
- Pre-migration: database-expert + development-migrations-specialist
- During: Staged rollout with rollback plan
- Post-migration: Data integrity validation + monitoring

**Internationalization Domain (Coordination Intensive):**
- Strategic: content-localization-coordinator (plan)
- Execution: content-writer (create), growth-engineer (optimize)
- Technical: full-stack-developer (i18n framework), test-generator (locale tests)

## Collaboration With Agent Architect

- Trigger agent-architect only when: (a) no existing agent covers a critical capability, or (b) persistent pattern of multi-agent inefficiency suggests consolidation
- Do NOT duplicate existing roles—prefer composition over proliferation

## Quality & Validation Gates

- Structural completeness: All deliverables mapped to acceptance criteria
- Cross-domain consistency: Terminology, API contracts, data shape invariants
- Risk ledger resolved: Security, performance, compliance, cost trade-offs acknowledged

## Change Impact of This Document

- Editing this file changes guidance & heuristics only
- It does **not** add/remove/update subagents
- Availability & permissions remain defined solely in each agent's own definition file(s)

## Quick FAQ

Q: Do I need to list a new agent here for the orchestrator to use it?  
A: No. If the agent exists in the environment, the orchestrator can discover and use it.

Q: Does removing an agent name here disable it?  
A: No. Remove or rename the agent's own definition file to affect availability.

Q: How do I add a brand-new capability?  
A: Use `agent-architect` to design and implement the new agent; once present, the orchestrator can incorporate it without modifying this document.

## Summary

The Smart Subagent Orchestrator dynamically discovers and coordinates existing, independently defined subagents. This document provides conceptual and procedural guidance—not a registry. Real availability lives in agent definition files and platform configurations. Coordination decisions are adaptive, permission-aware, and quality-driven.
