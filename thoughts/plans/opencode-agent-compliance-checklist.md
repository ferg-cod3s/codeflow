# OpenCode Agent Compliance & Cleanup Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan addresses agent invocation errors and registry/documentation drift in the CodeFlow system by enforcing strict agent naming, location, and reference conventions. The goal is to ensure all agents are correctly named (kebab-case), implemented, and referenced consistently across `.opencode/agent/`, registry, manifest, and documentation, with all duplicates and legacy files removed.

## Current State Analysis

- Agents are inconsistently named (snake_case, PascalCase, kebab-case) across files, registry, and documentation.
- Many agents are missing from `.opencode/agent/` or use the wrong format.
- Duplicates exist in deprecated/backup folders.
- Registry and documentation do not always match file names.
- YAML frontmatter compliance is not guaranteed.

### Key Discoveries:

- Official convention: **kebab-case** for all agent file names and references (see `thoughts/research/2025-09-07_opencode-agents-problems.md`, `docs/AGENT_REGISTRY.md`).
- All project agents must live in `.opencode/agent/`.
- Registry, manifest, and documentation must match file names exactly.
- Some agents are missing, some are duplicated, some use the wrong format.

## Desired End State

- All agent files in `.opencode/agent/` use kebab-case naming and are present for every required agent.
- Registry, manifest, and documentation reference agents using kebab-case only.
- No duplicate or legacy agent files in deprecated/backup folders.
- All agent markdown files have valid YAML frontmatter.
- All required agents are implemented and referenced consistently.

### Verification

- Automated: `codeflow validate`, `codeflow convert-all --dry-run`, `codeflow convert-all`, lint/typecheck, test suite.
- Manual: Spot check agent invocation, registry, and documentation for naming/format compliance.

## What We're NOT Doing

- Not rewriting agent logic or prompts (only file/metadata/registry compliance).
- Not migrating global agents (`~/.config/opencode/agent/`).
- Not updating legacy/deprecated agents unless they are referenced in the registry.
- Not changing agent model assignments or tool configurations unless required for compliance.

## UPDATE: Subdirectory Issue Addressed

**Issue:** OpenCode agents must be in a single directory (flat structure), not subdirectories.

**Resolution:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

- Created proper `.opencode/agent/` directory with flat structure
- Copied all 29 agents from `test-setup/.opencode/agent/` to main project
- All agents now in correct location: `/Users/johnferguson/Github/codeflow/.opencode/agent/`
- Created `.opencode/command/` directory with 7 workflow commands
- This addresses the core issue mentioned in the original problem statement

## Implementation Approach

- Audit all agent files, registry, manifest, and documentation for compliance.
- Rename/move files as needed to `.opencode/agent/` using kebab-case.
- Remove duplicates and legacy files.
- Update registry, manifest, and documentation to match.
- Validate YAML frontmatter for all agents.
- Implement missing agents as markdown files.

## Phase 1: Audit & Checklist Creation

### Overview

Create a comprehensive checklist of all agents, noting compliance issues and required actions.

### Changes Required:

- Audit `.opencode/agent/`, `codeflow-agents/`, registry, manifest, and documentation.
- For each agent, record:
  - Current file name(s) and location(s)
  - Registry and documentation references
  - Compliance issues (naming, location, duplicates, missing)
  - Required actions (rename, move, update references, implement)

### Success Criteria:

- [ ] Checklist created for every agent with actionable items
- [ ] All compliance issues identified

---

## Phase 2: File Renaming, Moving, and Deduplication

### Overview

Rename and move agent files to `.opencode/agent/` using kebab-case. Remove duplicates and legacy files.

### Changes Required:

- For each agent in the checklist:
  - Rename file to kebab-case if needed
  - Move file to `.opencode/agent/`
  - Remove duplicates from deprecated/backup folders

### Success Criteria:

- [ ] All agent files in `.opencode/agent/` use kebab-case
- [ ] No duplicates or legacy files remain

---

## Phase 3: Registry, Manifest, and Documentation Update

### Overview

Update registry, manifest, and documentation to reference agents using kebab-case only.

### Changes Required:

- For each agent:
  - Update registry and manifest entries to match file name
  - Update documentation references to match file name

### Success Criteria:

- [ ] Registry, manifest, and documentation reference agents using kebab-case
- [ ] No mismatches remain

---

## Phase 4: YAML Frontmatter Validation & Agent Implementation

### Overview

Validate YAML frontmatter for all agent markdown files. Implement missing agents as needed.

### Changes Required:

- For each agent file:
  - Validate YAML frontmatter (required fields: description, mode, tools)
  - Implement missing agents as markdown files with valid frontmatter

### Success Criteria:

- [ ] All agent files have valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] All required agents are implemented

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:

- Validate agent file naming and location
- Test registry/manifest sync logic
- Test YAML frontmatter validation

### Integration Tests:

- End-to-end agent invocation using registry and manifest
- Registry/documentation sync checks

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. Spot check agent invocation for several agents
2. Verify registry and documentation references
3. Confirm no duplicates or legacy files remain
4. Validate YAML frontmatter for random agents

## Performance Considerations

- Batch file operations for renaming/moving
- Use automated validation and conversion tools

## Migration Notes

- Remove legacy/deprecated agents only if not referenced
- Document all changes for rollback if needed

## Review

I've created the initial implementation plan at:
`thoughts/plans/opencode-agent-compliance-checklist.md`

Please review it and let me know:

- Are the phases properly scoped?
- Are the success criteria specific enough?
- Any technical details that need adjustment?
- Missing edge cases or considerations?

I will iterate and refine based on your feedback until the plan is complete and actionable.
