## Ticket Synopsis

Implement optimization of the smart-subagent-orchestrator prompt to ensure efficient operation and working parallel subagent spawning across both OpenCode and Claude Code environments.

## Summary

The smart-subagent-orchestrator prompt contains critical issues preventing effective cross-platform operation: incorrect MCP tool assumptions, excessive verbosity (295 lines), platform invocation confusion, and missing context function documentation. This implementation plan outlines a phased approach to optimize the prompt for both Claude Code and OpenCode/MCP environments.

## Detailed Analysis

### Current Issues

#### 1. MCP Tool Availability Mismatch
- **Problem**: Prompt references `codeflow.agent.<name>` tools that don't exist
- **Impact**: Users attempt non-existent tools in OpenCode, causing failures
- **Evidence**: Lines 56-57, 101, 183, 246 in smart-subagent-orchestrator.md

#### 2. Excessive Prompt Length  
- **Problem**: 295-line prompt exceeds context windows and increases cognitive load
- **Impact**: Potential context window issues and reduced efficiency
- **Evidence**: Multiple redundant sections repeating orchestration concepts

#### 3. Platform Invocation Confusion
- **Problem**: Invocation patterns scattered and not clearly differentiated
- **Impact**: Users confused about correct syntax for each platform
- **Evidence**: Mixed references to Task tool, MCP tools, and context functions

#### 4. Missing Context Function Documentation
- **Problem**: No explanation of workflow command agent functions
- **Impact**: Users don't know how to properly spawn agents in OpenCode
- **Evidence**: Context functions (spawnAgent, parallelAgents) not documented in prompt

### Technical Architecture

#### Current Implementation
```javascript
// MCP server provides agent functions in workflow command context
const context = {
  spawnAgent: (agentId, task) => spawnAgentTask(agentId, task, globalAgentRegistry),
  parallelAgents: (agentIds, tasks) => executeParallelAgents(agentIds, tasks, globalAgentRegistry),
  sequentialAgents: (agentSpecs) => executeSequentialAgents(agentSpecs, globalAgentRegistry)
}
```

#### Platform Invocation Patterns
| Platform | Method | Parallel Support | Agent Discovery |
|----------|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `Task(subagent_type: "agent-name")` | ✅ Works | Dynamic |
| OpenCode | Context functions in workflow commands | ✅ Works | Static list |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Prompt Structure Optimization

#### Overview
Restructure the smart-subagent-orchestrator.md prompt to remove incorrect assumptions, add clear platform guidance, and condense verbose sections.

#### Tasks

##### 1.1 Remove MCP Tool References
- **File**: `codeflow-agents/generalist/smart-subagent-orchestrator.md`
- **Changes**: 
  - Remove all `codeflow.agent.<name>` references (lines 56-57, 101, 183, 246)
  - Replace with context function usage examples
- **Success Criteria**: No references to non-existent MCP tools remain

##### 1.2 Add Platform-Specific Invocation Sections
- **File**: `codeflow-agents/generalist/smart-subagent-orchestrator.md` 
- **Changes**:
  - Add clear "Claude Code" section with Task tool examples
  - Add clear "OpenCode/MCP" section with context function examples
  - Remove scattered platform references
