## Ticket Synopsis

This research analyzes the results of a comprehensive subagent test run after executing `codeflow setup` on an empty folder. The ticket summarizes outputs, capabilities, and limitations for all tested subagents, highlighting actionable results, missing agent types, and documentation patterns. It includes a summary table, observations, and recommendations for agent registry review, onboarding, and troubleshooting.

## Summary

- **Core workflow, development, quality, and operations agents** are implemented and available in multiple formats and directories.
- **Several agent names referenced in documentation** (e.g., `mobile-optimizer`, `integration-master`, `content-writer`) do **not** exist as implemented agents; they are placeholders or future plans.
- **Agent registry logic** is robust, with extensive QA, validation, and documentation, but some agent types are missing or misnamed.
- **Onboarding and setup patterns** are well-documented, with guides in `README.md`, `docs/`, and `thoughts/`.
- **Historical context** from the `thoughts/` directory highlights registry QA, setup failures, permission issues, and architecture changes.
- **Recommendation:** Review registry and update/correct agent names as needed. Use onboarding documentation for agent setup and troubleshooting.

## Detailed Findings

### Core Workflow Agents

- Defined in:
  - `codeflow-agents/development/codebase-locator.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/development/codebase-analyzer.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/development/codebase-pattern-finder.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/generalist/thoughts-locator.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/generalist/thoughts-analyzer.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/generalist/web-search-researcher.md`
- Orchestrated via:
  - `mcp/agent-registry.mjs`
  - `packages/agentic-mcp/src/agent-registry.ts`
  - `src/cli/sync.ts`
- Documented in:
  - `docs/AGENT_REGISTRY.md`
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `AGENT_MANIFEST.json`

**Implementation Details:**

- Agents are present in multiple formats (Claude, OpenCode, legacy, backup).
- Registry and orchestration logic is centralized in MCP server and CLI sync scripts.

### Development & Engineering Agents

- Defined in:
  - `codeflow-agents/full-stack-developer.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/api-builder.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/database-expert.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/performance-engineer.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/system-architect.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/ai-integration-expert.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/development-migrations-specialist.md`
- Documentation and orchestration:
  - `agent-architect.md`
  - `smart-subagent-orchestrator.md`
  - `docs/AGENT_REGISTRY.md`

**Implementation Details:**

- All major agent types are present in multiple formats for compatibility, legacy, backup, and testing.
- Orchestration and coordination described in architect/orchestrator files.

### Quality & Security Agents

- Defined in:
  - `codeflow-agents/code-reviewer.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/security-scanner.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/quality-testing-performance-tester.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/accessibility-pro.md`
- Coordination in orchestrator files, registry in MCP server files.

**Implementation Details:**

- Consistent naming and clustering by domain.
- Multiple format variants and legacy/test/backup copies.

### Operations & Infrastructure Agents

- Defined in:
  - `codeflow-agents/devops-operations-specialist.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/infrastructure-builder.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/deployment-wizard.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/monitoring-expert.md`
  - `codeflow-agents/operations-incident-commander.md`
- Registry and orchestration in MCP server and agent-architect files.

**Implementation Details:**

- Grouped by domain, with legacy and backup copies.
- Documented in registry and orchestrator files.

### Agents Returning 'Unknown agent type'

- Agents like `mobile-optimizer`, `integration-master`, `content-writer` do **NOT** exist as implemented agents.
- Only referenced in documentation and registry lists (primarily in orchestrator and architect markdown files).
- No source code, configuration, or type definition files exist for these agent types.
- They are placeholders or future plans.

### Agent Registry and Implementation Status

- Core registry logic in:
  - `mcp/agent-registry.mjs`
  - `packages/agentic-mcp/src/agent-registry.ts`
  - `src/cli/status.ts`
- Documentation and QA reporting in `thoughts/`, `docs/`, and CLI status commands.
- Debug/test scripts for registry logic in `scripts/`.

**Implementation Details:**

- Registry implemented in both JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Extensive documentation and QA reporting.
- Status surfaced via CLI and MCP tools.

### Documentation and Onboarding Patterns

- Main guides in:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/AGENT_REGISTRY.md`
  - `docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md`
  - Onboarding-specific files in `thoughts/documentation/` and `thoughts/plans/`
- Setup and onboarding patterns described in agent definition files and command documentation.

**Implementation Details:**

- Files with `setup`, `onboard`, `install`, `quickstart` in names are highly relevant.
- Documentation files in `docs/` and `thoughts/` directories provide high-level and detailed onboarding patterns.

## Architecture Insights

- **Agent definitions** are Markdown-based and exist in multiple formats for platform compatibility.
- **Registry and orchestration** are centralized in MCP server and CLI scripts.
- **Onboarding and setup** are documented in multiple places, ensuring reproducibility and troubleshooting.
- **Missing agents** are often placeholders in documentation, not implementation gaps.
- **Legacy, backup, and test copies** ensure robust migration and recovery.

## Open Questions

- Which agents referenced in documentation are planned for future implementation?
- Are there any additional onboarding issues not covered in the current documentation?
- Should agent registry validation be further automated to catch naming and implementation drift?
- Is there a need to consolidate legacy and backup agent definitions for clarity?
