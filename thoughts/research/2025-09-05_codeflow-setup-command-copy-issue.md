## Ticket Synopsis

User reports that when running `codeflow setup` for a specific project with Claude Code, commands aren't properly being set up in that project. The expectation is that commands should be copied to `.claude/commands/` directory during project setup.

## Summary

**Root Cause Found**: The `CommandSetupStrategy` in `src/cli/setup.ts:80` is looking for commands in `{sourcePath}/command` directory, but the actual source commands are located in `.claude/commands/` and `.opencode/command/` directories. This mismatch prevents commands from being copied during Claude Code project setup.

**Impact**: Claude Code projects created with `codeflow setup` do not receive the slash commands (research, plan, execute, etc.), making the workflow incomplete.

**Status**: Critical bug affecting Claude Code integration workflow.

## Detailed Findings

### Command Source Location Issue

**Problem**: `CommandSetupStrategy.setup()` looks for source commands in wrong directory
- **Expected**: `{codeflowRoot}/.claude/commands/` for Claude Code projects
- **Actual**: `{codeflowRoot}/command/` (doesn't exist)
- **Code Location**: `src/cli/setup.ts:80`

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE
async setup(sourcePath: string, targetDir: string, projectType: ProjectType) {
  // For commands, always use the command source directory
  const sourceDir = join(sourcePath, 'command');  // ❌ WRONG PATH
  
  if (!existsSync(sourceDir)) {
    result.errors.push(`Source directory not found: ${sourceDir}`);
    return result;  // ❌ FAILS HERE
  }
```

### Correct Command Locations

**Source Commands Available**:
- **Claude Code Format**: `/Users/johnferguson/Github/codeflow/.claude/commands/` (7 files)
- **OpenCode Format**: `/Users/johnferguson/Github/codeflow/.opencode/command/` (7 files)
- **Non-existent**: `/Users/johnferguson/Github/codeflow/command/` (7 files)

**Target Locations**:
- **Claude Code Projects**: `{project}/.claude/commands/`
- **OpenCode Projects**: `{project}/.opencode/command/`

### Project Type Detection Working Correctly

**Found**: Project type detection logic works properly (`src/cli/setup.ts:164-207`)
- Correctly identifies Claude Code projects by checking for `.claude/claude_config.json`, `.claude/commands`, etc.
- Sets up appropriate target directories: `['.claude/commands', '.claude/agents']`
- Creates `.claude/claude_config.json` with correct configuration

### Command Format Differences

**Claude Code Format** (`.claude/commands/research.md`):
```markdown

name: Research
description: "Comprehensive codebase and documentation analysis"
author: "Codeflow Team"
version: "1.0.0"

# Research Command
[Simple markdown content]
```

**OpenCode Format** (`.opencode/command/research.md`):
```markdown

version: "1.0.0"

### Strategy Pattern Implementation

**Current Logic** (`src/cli/setup.ts:371-404`):
- Uses strategy pattern with `CommandSetupStrategy` and `AgentSetupStrategyImpl`
- `CommandSetupStrategy.shouldHandle()` returns `true` for directories containing "command"
- Both `.claude/commands` and `.opencode/command` match this pattern
- Problem: Both use the same hardcoded `join(sourcePath, 'command')` path

## Code References

- `src/cli/setup.ts:80` - Incorrect source path construction in CommandSetupStrategy
- `src/cli/setup.ts:164-207` - Project type detection (working correctly)
- `src/cli/setup.ts:371-404` - Strategy selection and execution
- `.claude/commands/` - Actual Claude Code command files (7 files)
- `.opencode/command/` - Actual OpenCode command files (7 files)

## Architecture Insights

**Current Architecture**:
- Strategy pattern correctly identifies command vs agent setup needs
- Project type detection works properly
- Directory creation succeeds
- **Failure Point**: Source path resolution in command copying

**Expected Flow**:
1. Detect project type (Claude Code) ✅
2. Create target directories (`.claude/commands/`) ✅
3. Copy commands from source to target ❌ FAILS HERE

## Historical Context (from thoughts/)

No previous documentation found about this specific command setup issue. This appears to be a regression or oversight in the command copying implementation.

## Related Research

This is the first research document specifically addressing command setup failures in codeflow.

## Open Questions

1. **Why wasn't this caught in testing?** Are there tests covering the command copying functionality?
2. **When was this introduced?** Was this working previously, or has it never worked correctly?
3. **Does the same issue affect OpenCode setup?** The logic suggests it would have the same problem.

## Recommended Fix

**Solution**: Modify `CommandSetupStrategy` to use format-specific source paths:

```typescript
// PROPOSED FIX
async setup(sourcePath: string, targetDir: string, projectType: ProjectType) {
  // Determine source directory based on target format
  let sourceDir: string;
  
  if (targetDir.includes('.claude/commands')) {
    sourceDir = join(sourcePath, '.claude', 'commands');
  } else if (targetDir.includes('.opencode/command')) {
    sourceDir = join(sourcePath, '.opencode', 'command');
  } else {
    // Fallback for other formats
    sourceDir = join(sourcePath, 'command');
  }
  
  if (!existsSync(sourceDir)) {
    result.errors.push(`Source directory not found: ${sourceDir}`);
    return result;
  }
  // Continue with existing file copying logic...
}
```

**Priority**: High - this breaks the core workflow for Claude Code users.
