## Ticket Synopsis
User reports an issue with OpenCode version 0.7.0 where it's unable to apply changes to folders after installation. The issue was noticed specifically in the `~/Github/opencode-nexus` repository, suggesting this may be a compatibility issue between OpenCode v0.7.0 and the codeflow CLI's file system operations.

## Summary
Investigation reveals potential compatibility conflicts between OpenCode v0.7.0's folder change mechanisms and the codeflow CLI's file system operations. The codeflow system implements atomic file operations, explicit permission setting, and directory structure management that may interfere with OpenCode's ability to apply changes to folders. No specific v0.7.0 references were found in the codebase, indicating this is likely an external compatibility issue rather than a direct codeflow problem.

## Detailed Findings

### File System Architecture
The codeflow CLI implements a sophisticated file system abstraction with multiple layers:
- **FileSystemService** (`src/services/FileSystemService.ts:1-300`) - Core atomic operations
- **AgentService** (`src/services/AgentService.ts:1-250`) - Agent file management 
- **CommandService** (`src/services/CommandService.ts:52-89`) - Command file synchronization
- **CLI Commands** (`src/cli/index.ts:85-120`) - User-facing setup/sync operations

### Directory Structure Management
The system creates standardized directory structures for both Claude Code and OpenCode formats:
- `.claude/commands/` - Claude Code format commands
- `.claude/prompts/` - Prompt templates
- `.opencode/command/` - OpenCode format commands
- `.opencode/agent/` - OpenCode format agents

**Key Implementation** (`src/services/FileSystemService.ts:150-185`):
```typescript
async createProjectStructure(projectPath: string): Promise<void> {
  const directories = [
    path.join(projectPath, '.claude', 'commands'),
    path.join(projectPath, '.opencode', 'command'),
    path.join(projectPath, '.opencode', 'agent')
  ];
  
  for (const dir of directories) {
    await this.ensureDirectory(dir);
    await fs.chmod(dir, 0o755); // Explicit permission setting
  }
}
```

### Atomic File Operations
The system uses a temporary file + rename pattern for safe file operations (`src/services/FileSystemService.ts:95-145`):
```typescript
const tempFile = `${destination}.tmp`;
await fs.copyFile(source, tempFile);
await fs.rename(tempFile, destination);
```

### File Change Detection
Uses modification time comparison for synchronization (`src/services/AgentService.ts:45-70`):
```typescript
const [sourceStat, destStat] = await Promise.all([
  fs.stat(source),
  fs.stat(dest).catch(() => null)
]);
return sourceStat.mtime > destStat.mtime;
```

## Architecture Insights

### Permission Model
- Hardcoded directory permissions (`0o755`) set explicitly
- Write permission validation before operations
- No consideration for OpenCode's expected permission model

### Atomic Operations Pattern
- All file writes use temporary file + rename for atomicity
- May interfere with file system watchers expecting direct writes
- Could cause OpenCode to miss file change events

### Concurrent Operation Handling
- No explicit locking mechanism for concurrent access
- Multiple directory operations performed sequentially
- Potential race conditions with external tools

### Error Handling Strategy
- Custom `FileSystemError` class with context preservation
- Graceful fallbacks (e.g., file comparison defaults to "update needed")
- Cleanup of temporary files on operation failure

## Potential OpenCode v0.7.0 Compatibility Issues

### 1. Directory Permission Conflicts
**Location**: `src/services/FileSystemService.ts:175`
**Issue**: Codeflow sets directory permissions to `0o755` explicitly, which may conflict with OpenCode v0.7.0's expected permission model.
**Impact**: OpenCode may fail to write to directories or encounter permission denied errors.

### 2. Atomic Write Interference
**Location**: `src/services/FileSystemService.ts:125-140`
**Issue**: The temporary file + rename pattern may interfere with OpenCode's file system monitoring.
**Impact**: OpenCode v0.7.0 might not detect file changes if watching the destination file during atomic operations.

### 3. Race Condition Windows
**Location**: `src/services/FileSystemService.ts:55-70`
**Issue**: Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) gaps between `fs.access()` validation and actual operations.
**Impact**: OpenCode operations occurring simultaneously could cause unexpected failures.

### 4. Directory Structure Expectations
**Location**: `src/services/FileSystemService.ts:150-185`
**Issue**: Codeflow creates specific directory structures that OpenCode v0.7.0 might not expect or handle correctly.
**Impact**: OpenCode may attempt to write to paths that don't align with codeflow's structure.

### 5. File Change Detection Logic
**Location**: `src/services/AgentService.ts:65`
**Issue**: Modification time comparison may not account for OpenCode's file change semantics.
**Impact**: Files may appear up-to-date to codeflow but out-of-sync with OpenCode's view.

## Historical Context (from thoughts/)
No existing documentation was found regarding OpenCode compatibility issues or version-specific problems. This appears to be the first documented instance of OpenCode v0.7.0 folder operation conflicts.

## Related Research
This is the initial research document for this issue. No previous research documents exist for OpenCode compatibility problems.

## Open Questions
1. **What specific folder operations is OpenCode v0.7.0 attempting that fail?**
   - File creation, modification, or deletion?
   - Directory creation or restructuring?
   - Permission changes?

2. **Does the issue occur with all folder operations or specific patterns?**
   - Only `.opencode/` directories?
   - Any directory with codeflow-managed files?
   - Specific file types or extensions?

3. **Are there error messages or logs from OpenCode v0.7.0?**
   - Permission denied errors?
   - File not found errors?
   - Operation timeout errors?

4. **Has this issue been reported to the OpenCode project?**
   - Known bug in v0.7.0?
   - Breaking changes in folder handling?
   - Compatibility matrix with external tools?

5. **Can the issue be reproduced in a clean environment?**
   - Fresh OpenCode v0.7.0 installation?
   - New project without existing codeflow setup?
   - Specific sequence of operations that trigger the issue?

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Gather specific error messages from OpenCode v0.7.0
2. Test with a minimal reproduction case
3. Compare behavior with OpenCode v0.6.x
4. Consider implementing OpenCode-aware file operations in codeflow
5. Add compatibility detection and warnings for known conflicts
