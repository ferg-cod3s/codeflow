# Update Documentation for Artifact/Model Handling and Drift Detection

Update the following documentation files to reflect recent changes:

1. In CLAUDE.md:
   - Add a clear section explaining that `.opencode/` and `.claude/` directories are generated artifacts and must not be committed to git. Reference the updated `.gitignore` policy.
   - Document the model allowlist: only `opencode/code-supernova` and `opencode/grok-code` are valid for OpenCode agents. Omission of the `model:` field is allowed/preferred for using platform defaults.
   - Briefly mention the new drift detection workflow that checks for uncommitted changes or invalid model usage.

2. In docs/usage.md:
   - Update usage/setup instructions to clarify that `.opencode/` and `.claude/` are generated, not tracked in git, and will be overwritten/regenerated as needed.
   - Explain that model selection is now restricted to the allowlist, and omitting the `model:` field is supported and recommended for most users.

3. (Optional) In README.md:
   - Add a short note about the artifact policy and link to the relevant section in CLAUDE.md or usage.md.

Be concise but explicit. Use clear headings and bullet points where helpful. Do not change any code or configurationâ€”documentation only. Summarize your changes at the top of each file in a brief changelog note.
