## Keyword Density Guidelines

**Best Practice Recommendations: **

- Primary keyword: 0.5-1.5% density
- Avoid keyword stuffing

5. Generate LSI keywords based on topic
6. Suggest optimal keyword distribution
7. Flag over-optimization issues

## Output

**Keyword Strategy Package: **

```
Primary: [keyword] (0.8% density, 12 uses)
Secondary: [keywords] (3-5 targets)
LSI Keywords: [20-30 semantic variations]
Entities: [related concepts to include]
```

**Deliverables: **

- Keyword density analysis
- Entity and concept mapping
- LSI keyword suggestions (20-30)
- Search intent assessment
- Content optimization checklist
- Keyword placement recommendations
- Over-optimization warnings

**Advanced Recommendations: **
