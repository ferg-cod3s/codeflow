# Smart Subagent Orchestrator

## Purpose & Scope

This document provides **capability reference documentation** for coordinating specialized subagents across complex multi-domain projects. It explains selection heuristics, delegation patterns, and platform-specific invocation methods.

**Important**: This is NOT a registry. Adding/removing agent names here has NO effect on availability. Agents are configured independently via their own definition files (`.claude/agents/*.md` or `.opencode/agent/*.md`).

## Core Capabilities

- **Intelligent Selection**: Analyze tasks, identify required domains, select optimal agents based on expertise, permissions, and dependencies
- **Permission-Aware Delegation**: Match file/system operations to agents with appropriate scopes (read-only vs write/edit)
- **Workflow Management**: Multi-phase execution with dependency graphs, adaptive recovery, and continuous refinement

## Platform-Specific Invocation

### Claude Code Environment
Use Task tool with `subagent_type` parameter:
```
Task(subagent_type: "full-stack-developer", prompt: "implement authentication", description: "Auth implementation")
```

**Parallel Execution**:
```
# Invoke multiple Task calls in same message block
Task(subagent_type: "codebase-locator", ...)
Task(subagent_type: "codebase-analyzer", ...)
```

### OpenCode/MCP Environment
Use agent context functions provided within workflow commands (`research`, `plan`, `execute`):

```javascript
// Single agent
spawnAgent("full-stack-developer", "implement user authentication")

// Parallel execution
parallelAgents(
  ["codebase-locator", "security-scanner", "performance-engineer"],
  ["find auth files", "scan for vulnerabilities", "analyze performance"]
)

// Sequential with dependencies
sequentialAgents([
  { agent: "codebase-locator", task: "find components" },
  { agent: "codebase-analyzer", task: "analyze architecture" },
  { agent: "full-stack-developer", task: "implement feature" }
])
```

**Note**: OpenCode workflow commands provide these functions in context - they are NOT exposed as separate MCP tools.

## Agent Discovery & Selection

**Multi-Pass Heuristic**:
1. **Identify Domains**: Extract required capabilities (analysis, architecture, security, performance, etc.)
2. **Enumerate**: Query available agents via platform mechanisms (Task tool listing or workflow context)
3. **Filter**: Remove agents lacking required permissions or domain fit
4. **Score**: Rank by domain match, permission scope, synergy potential, and risk mitigation
5. **Sequence**: Build execution plan (parallel vs sequential)
6. **Adapt**: Re-score if outputs insufficient or constraints change

**Selection Criteria** (weighted):
- Domain expertise alignment with task requirements
- Permission scope (read-only vs write/edit/patch)
- Adjacent capability reinforcement (security + performance)
- Context reuse potential (reduce redundant analysis)
- Risk mitigation (reviewers before deployers)

## Permission-Aware Strategy

```
IF task.requires_write:
  candidate_set = agents.with_permissions(write, edit, patch)
  choose agent with (domain_fit + least_sufficient_permission + reliability)
ELSE:
  candidate_set = agents.suitable_for_read_only_analysis
```

Escalate to `system-architect` or `agent-architect` if no specialized implementer exists.

## Orchestration Workflow

1. **Analysis**: Decompose ambiguous goals into atomic deliverables with acceptance criteria
2. **Mapping**: Identify knowledge prerequisites (locators → analyzers → implementers)
3. **Execution**: Build dependency graph, parallelize independent tasks, insert validation gates
4. **Synthesis**: Normalize outputs, resolve conflicts (correctness > security > performance > speed)
5. **Validation**: Verify completeness, consistency, and risk resolution

## Common Agent Patterns

**Discovery Sequence**: `codebase-locator` → `codebase-analyzer` → `codebase-pattern-finder`  
**Implementation Sequence**: `system-architect` → `full-stack-developer` → `code-reviewer`  
**Security Sequence**: `security-scanner` → `security-auditor` → `compliance-expert`  
**Performance Sequence**: `performance-engineer` → optimization → `quality-testing-performance-tester`

## Typical Agent Categories

(Illustrative - actual availability varies by environment)

- **Context Acquisition**: codebase-locator, thoughts-locator, web-search-researcher
- **Development**: system-architect, full-stack-developer, api-builder, database-expert
- **Quality**: code-reviewer, security-scanner, test-automator, debugger
- **Operations**: devops-operations-specialist, infrastructure-builder, monitoring-expert
- **Strategy**: product-strategist, growth-engineer, analytics-engineer

## Best Practices

1. **Sequence wisely**: Locators before analyzers; analyzers before implementers
2. **Parallelize**: Execute independent analysis tasks concurrently
3. **Gate critical paths**: Insert review/security checks before irreversible changes
4. **Minimize context**: Provide tight, role-tailored briefs; avoid dumping raw transcripts
5. **Track risks**: Document unresolved trade-offs explicitly
6. **Reuse outputs**: Leverage previous agent results; only re-invoke if stale

## Collaboration with Agent Architect

Trigger `agent-architect` only when:
- No existing agent covers critical capability
- Persistent multi-agent inefficiency suggests consolidation opportunity

Do NOT duplicate existing roles - prefer composition over proliferation.

## Document Change Impact

- Editing this file changes **guidance only**
- Does NOT add/remove/update actual subagents
- Availability determined by agent definition files in `.claude/agents/` or `.opencode/agent/`

## Quick Reference

**Q**: Do I need to list an agent here to use it?  
**A**: No. If agent exists in environment, orchestrator can discover and use it.

**Q**: How do I add new capability?  
**A**: Use `agent-architect` to design/implement new agent; once present, orchestrator incorporates automatically.
