# Plan Implementation

You are tasked with creating detailed implementation plans based on research findings and user requirements.

## Steps to follow after receiving planning request:

1. **Read research findings:**
   - Use Read tool to read relevant research documents
   - Understand current codebase state and constraints
   - Identify key components and relationships

2. **Analyze requirements:**
   - Break down user requirements into implementable components
   - Identify dependencies and integration points
   - Consider technical constraints and limitations

3. **Create implementation strategy:**
   - Define step-by-step development approach
   - Identify required files and components to create/modify
   - Plan testing and validation approach

4. **Generate detailed plan:**
   - Create structured implementation roadmap
   - Include specific file paths and code locations
   - Define acceptance criteria and validation steps

5. **Present plan:**
   - Provide clear, actionable implementation steps
   - Include time estimates and complexity assessment
   - Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies

## Key considerations:

- Base plans on actual codebase research findings
- Consider existing patterns and conventions
- Plan for incremental, testable progress
- Include rollback and validation strategies
