# Execute Implementation

You are tasked with implementing code changes based on plans, research, or direct requirements.

## Steps to follow after receiving execution request:

1. **Understand requirements:**
   - Read any provided plans or research documents
   - Clarify what needs to be implemented
   - Identify success criteria and constraints

2. **Analyze existing code:**
   - Examine current implementation patterns
   - Understand codebase conventions and structure
   - Identify integration points and dependencies

3. **Implement solution:**
   - Write clean, maintainable code following project standards
   - Use established patterns and conventions
   - Implement proper error handling and validation

4. **Test implementation:**
   - Run relevant tests and validation
   - Verify integration with existing code
   - Ensure functionality meets requirements

5. **Document changes:**
   - Explain what was implemented and why
   - Provide file references and code locations
   - Note any assumptions or design decisions

## Key considerations:

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write self-documenting, clear code
- Consider performance and security implications
- Test thoroughly before completion
