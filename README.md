# Codeflow - AI Agent & Command Management CLI

A TypeScript-based CLI tool for managing Claude Code, OpenCode, and MCP-compatible client agents and commands. Ensures compliance with Claude Code v2.x.x, OpenCode, and MCP specifications through automated validation and conversion.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies and link CLI
bun install && bun run install

# Setup agents and commands in a project
codeflow setup [project-path]

# Check compliance status
codeflow status [project-path]

# Sync with latest agents/commands
codeflow sync [project-path]

# Convert between formats
codeflow convert source/ target/ --format claude-code
```

## Format Compliance

This tool enforces **Claude Code v2.x.x**, **OpenCode**, and **MCP** specifications. See [COMPLIANCE.md](./COMPLIANCE.md) for detailed format requirements and migration guide.

**Key Points:**

- Claude Code v2.x.x only allows: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`
- OpenCode requires: `name`, `description`, `mode` + optional fields
- MCP clients use JSON parameter format for tool calls
- Converter automatically strips invalid fields during conversion
- Validator catches compliance issues before deployment

## Codeflow Workflow

### Available Commands

- `/research` - Comprehensive codebase and documentation analysis
- `/plan` - Create detailed implementation plans
- `/execute` - Implement plans with verification
- `/test` - Generate comprehensive test suites
- `/document` - Create user guides and API documentation
- `/commit` - Create structured git commits
- `/review` - Validate implementations against plans
- `/project-docs` - Generate complete project documentation

### Claude Code Integration

Commands are located in `.claude/commands/`.

### OpenCode Integration

Commands are located in `.opencode/command/`.

### MCP-Compatible Clients Integration

Commands are accessed via MCP tool calls with JSON parameters in Cursor, VS Code, and other MCP-compatible editors.


## Architecture

### Base Format (Source of Truth)

Agents are defined in `codeflow-agents/` organized by domain:
- `development/` - Full-stack, backend, frontend, mobile development
- `operations/` - DevOps, infrastructure, monitoring, incident response  
- `quality-testing/` - Testing, QA, performance, security scanning
- `ai-innovation/` - LLM integration, AI agents, prompt engineering
- `business-analytics/` - Data analysis, metrics, business intelligence
- `design-ux/` - UI/UX, accessibility, design systems
- `product-strategy/` - Product management, growth, requirements
- `generalist/` - General purpose agents and orchestrators

### Platform Conversion

Run `codeflow setup [project-path]` to convert base format agents to platform-specific formats:
- **Claude Code**: `.claude/commands/` (YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools, model)
- **OpenCode**: `.opencode/agent/` and `.opencode/command/` (YAML frontmatter with mode, temperature, allowed_directories)
- **MCP Clients**: JSON parameter format for tool calls in Cursor, VS Code, etc.

### Validation & Compliance

- Automated validation enforces Claude Code v2.x.x, OpenCode, and MCP specifications
- See [COMPLIANCE.md](./COMPLIANCE.md) for detailed requirements
- Use `codeflow status` to check compliance issues

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Support**: Convert between Claude Code, OpenCode, and MCP formats
- **Automated Validation**: Catch compliance issues before deployment
- **Base Format Management**: Single source of truth in `codeflow-agents/`
- **Sync Capabilities**: Keep project configs updated with `codeflow sync`
- **Watch Mode**: Automatic file synchronization with `codeflow watch start`

## Commands

Run `codeflow help` for full command documentation.
