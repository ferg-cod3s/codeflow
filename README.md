# Codeflow - AI Agent & Command Management CLI


Changelog (2025-10-13)
- Add short note about generated artifact policy and links to details in CLAUDE.md and docs/usage.md

A TypeScript-based CLI tool for managing Claude Code and OpenCode agents and commands. Ensures compliance with Claude Code v2.x.x and OpenCode specifications through automated validation and conversion.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies and link CLI
bun install && bun run install

# Setup agents and commands in a project
codeflow setup [project-path]

# Check compliance status
codeflow status [project-path]

# Sync with latest agents/commands
codeflow sync [project-path]

# Convert between formats
codeflow convert source/ target/ --format claude-code
```


### Note: Generated Artifacts (.opencode/, .claude/)

- These directories are generated and should not be committed to git (enforced via `.gitignore`).
- They may be overwritten/regenerated by setup and sync commands.
- See details: [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) and [Usage Guide](./docs/usage.md).

## Format Compliance

This tool enforces **Claude Code v2.x.x** and **OpenCode** specifications. See [COMPLIANCE.md](./COMPLIANCE.md) for detailed format requirements and migration guide.

**Key Points:**
- Claude Code v2.x.x only allows: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`
- OpenCode requires: `name`, `description`, `mode` + optional fields
- Converter automatically strips invalid fields during conversion
- Validator catches compliance issues before deployment
