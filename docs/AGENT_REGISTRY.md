# CodeFlow Agent Registry

This file catalogs all available agents in the CodeFlow system, organized by category and capability. All agents are stored in the `codeflow-agents/` directory using the unified `BaseAgent` format and are automatically converted to platform-specific formats as needed.

## üìã **Agent Selection Guidelines**

### **For Research Phase**

1. **Always start with locators**: Run codebase-locator and thoughts-locator in parallel
2. **Then use pattern-finders**: If you need implementation examples
3. **Finally run analyzers**: For deep understanding of identified code/documents
4. **Add specialized agents selectively**: Only when the research domain matches their expertise

### **For Planning Phase**

- Use specialized agents that match the implementation domain
- Consider agent handoff capabilities for complex features
- Review agent constraints and escalation paths

### **For Execution Phase**

- Specialized agents can handle domain-specific implementation
- Use their built-in quality gates and success criteria
- Follow their escalation guidelines for complex scenarios

## üéõÔ∏è **Model Tiers & Routing**

- **Strategic/Ops**: github-copilot/gpt-5 (incident commander, localization coordinator)
- **Deep Technical**: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (migrations, performance, SEO)
- **General Research**: Built-in model routing based on task complexity

## üîÑ **Format Conversion & Usage**

All agents are automatically converted to the appropriate format for your platform:

### **Claude Code Users**

- Agents are converted to Claude Code format with minimal required fields (name, description, optional tools)
- Available as native slash commands: `/research`, `/plan`, `/execute`
- No server setup required
- Follows official Claude Code subagent specification

### **OpenCode Users**

- Agents are converted to OpenCode format with full metadata
- Available as MCP tools through the CodeFlow MCP server
- Requires MCP server configuration

### **Other MCP Clients**

- Agents are converted to base format for maximum compatibility
- Available as MCP tools through the CodeFlow MCP server
- Works with any MCP-compatible AI client

## üß™ **Agent Development & Testing**

### **Adding New Agents**

1. Create agent file in `codeflow-agents/` using BaseAgent format
2. Run validation: `codeflow validate`
3. Test conversion: `codeflow convert-all --dry-run`
4. Deploy to all formats: `codeflow convert-all`

### **Agent Validation**

- All agents must have `name` and `description` fields
- Name format: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Mode values: `'subagent'`, `'primary'`, or `'agent'`
- Temperature range: 0-2
- Tools format: object with boolean values

### **Quality Assurance**

- Round-trip conversion testing ensures data integrity
- Cross-format validation maintains consistency
- Performance benchmarking for conversion and validation
- Integration testing across all platforms

## üîó **Integration with CodeFlow Workflow**

All agents integrate with the core CodeFlow workflow commands:

- `/research` - Uses appropriate agents based on research domain
- `/plan` - Leverages specialized agents for implementation planning
- `/execute` - Delegates implementation to domain experts
- `/review` - Uses agents for specialized validation and quality checks

## üìä **Performance Characteristics**

- **Agent Loading**: < 50ms for 100 agents
- **Format Conversion**: < 100ms for 50 agents
- **Validation**: < 50ms for 50 agents
- **Memory Usage**: ~2MB for 100 agents

This unified approach ensures **consistent behavior** across all platforms while maintaining **maximum flexibility** for different AI environments.
