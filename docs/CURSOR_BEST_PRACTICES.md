## Command Argument Handling

### Cursor Command System

Cursor uses a simpler command system compared to Claude Code. Commands are stored as Markdown files in `.cursor/commands/` and can be invoked using `/command-name`.

#### Argument Syntax

Cursor commands primarily use positional arguments that are passed directly to the command content:

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy application to environment
---

Deploying to environment: $1

!`echo "Deployment target: $1"`
!`if [ -z "$1" ]; then
echo "Error: Environment is required"
exit 1
fi

!`kubectl apply -f environments/$1/`
```

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
/deploy production
# $1 becomes "production"

/deploy staging
# $1 becomes "staging"
```

### Multiple Arguments

Cursor supports multiple positional arguments:

```markdown
---
name: review-pr
description: Review pull request with assignee
---

Reviewing PR #$1 and assigning to $2.

!`echo "PR Number: $1"`
!`echo "Assignee: $2"`
!`gh pr view $1`
!`gh pr edit $1 --add-assignee "$2"`
```

**Usage Examples:**

```bash
/review-pr 123 alice
# $1 becomes "123", $2 becomes "alice"

/review-pr 456
# $1 becomes "456", $2 is empty
```

### Argument Validation

#### Required Arguments

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to specified environment
---

# Validate required environment

!`if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: Environment is required"
  echo "Usage: /deploy <environment> [version]"
  exit 1
fi`

Environment: $1
Version: $2

!`echo "Deploying to $1 with version $2"`
```

#### Choice Validation

```markdown
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy to validated environment
---

# Validate environment choices

!`case "$1" in
  "development"|"staging"|"production")
    echo "‚úÖ Valid environment: $1"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "‚ùå Invalid environment: $1"
    echo "Valid environments: development, staging, production"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac`
```

## Rules Configuration (.cursorrules)

### Basic Rules Structure

Cursor uses `.cursorrules` files to provide AI context and behavioral guidance. This is where you define project-specific conventions and command patterns.

```plaintext
# Project Rules for AI Assistant

You are an expert developer working on this React/TypeScript project.

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow functional programming principles
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document complex business logic

## Architecture Decisions
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use custom hooks for shared logic
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow domain-driven design

## Command Patterns
- Use /deploy <environment> for deployments
- Use /test <component> for component testing
- Use /review <pr-number> for PR reviews

## File Conventions
- Components in src/components/
- Hooks in src/hooks/
- Utilities in src/utils/
- Tests in __tests__/ directories
```

### Command-Specific Rules

Define command usage patterns and expectations directly in rules:

```plaintext
## Command Usage Guidelines

### /deploy Command
- Usage: /deploy <environment> [version]
- Environments: development, staging, production
- Always validate environment before deployment
- Use kubectl for Kubernetes deployments

### /test Command
- Usage: /test <component|all>
- Components: auth, dashboard, api
- Use Jest for unit tests
- Use Cypress for E2E tests

### /review Command
- Usage: /review <pr-number> [priority]
- Priority: low, medium, high, critical
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify test coverage
- Validate code style
```

### Environment-Specific Rules

```plaintext
## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment
- Use local database
- Enable debug logging
- Hot reload enabled
- Mock external services

### Production Environment
- Use production database
- Disable debug logging
- Optimize for performance
- Use real external services
- Require approval for deployments
```

---

## Command Structure Patterns

### Standard Command Template

```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: Clear, concise description
---

# Command Name

Brief description of what this command does.

## Arguments

- **$1**: Description of first argument
- **$2**: Description of second argument (optional)

## Execution

!`echo "Executing command with arguments: $1 $2"`
```

### Multi-Step Commands

```markdown
---
name: full-deploy
description: Complete deployment pipeline
---

# Complete Deployment Pipeline

## Step 1: Validation

!`echo "Validating deployment to $1"`
!`if [ "$1" != "production" ] && [ "$1" != "staging" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Invalid environment: $1"
  exit 1
fi`

## Step 2: Build

!`echo "Building application"`
!`npm run build`

## Step 3: Deploy

!`echo "Deploying to $1"`
!`kubectl apply -f k8s/$1/`

## Step 4: Verification

!`echo "Verifying deployment"`
!`kubectl rollout status deployment/app -n $1`

‚úÖ Deployment completed successfully!
```

### Conditional Commands

```markdown
---
name: smart-deploy
description: Deploy with environment-specific logic
---

# Smart Deployment

Environment: $1

!`case "$1" in
  "production")
    echo "üöÄ Production deployment"
    echo "Running security scans..."
    npm run security-scan
    kubectl apply -f k8s/production/
    ;;
  "staging")
    echo "üß™ Staging deployment"
    kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
    npm run integration-tests
    ;;
  "development")
    echo "üíª Development deployment"
    kubectl apply -f k8s/development/
    ;;
  *)
    echo "‚ùå Unknown environment: $1"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac`
```

---

## Template Substitution Patterns

### Argument Substitution

#### Basic Positional Arguments

```markdown
---
name: greet
description: Greet team member
---

Hello, $1! Welcome to the project.

!`echo "Sending greeting to $1"`
```

#### Multiple Arguments

```markdown
---
name: create-component
description: Create React component
---

Creating component: $1
Type: $2
Path: src/components/$1/

!`mkdir -p src/components/$1`
!`cat > src/components/$1/$1.tsx << 'EOF'
import React from 'react';

interface $1Props {
// Define props here
}

const $1: React.FC<$1Props> = (props) => {
return (
<div>
<h1>$1 Component</h1>
</div>
);
};

export default $1;
EOF`

echo "‚úÖ Component $1 created successfully!"
```

### File References

Cursor supports file references using the `@` syntax:

```markdown
---
name: analyze-config
description: Analyze project configuration
---

Analyzing configuration files:

- Package: @package.json
- TypeScript: @tsconfig.json
- Environment: @.env.example

!`echo "Configuration analysis complete"`
```

### Shell Command Execution

#### Simple Commands

```markdown
---
name: status
description: Show project status
---

Current Project Status:

- Git Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git Status: !`git status --porcelain | wc -l` modified files
- Node Version: !`node --version`
- NPM Version: !`npm --version`
```

#### Complex Commands with Error Handling

```markdown
---
name: safe-deploy
description: Deploy with comprehensive error handling
---

!`set -e # Exit on error

echo "Starting deployment to $1..."

# Pre-deployment checks

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
echo "‚ùå Error: Environment is required"
exit 1
fi

# Deployment

if kubectl apply -f k8s/$1/; then
echo "‚úÖ Deployment successful"
else
echo "‚ùå Deployment failed"
exit 1
fi

# Post-deployment verification

kubectl rollout status deployment/app -n $1`
```

---

## Error Handling and Validation

### Input Validation Patterns

#### Required Arguments

```markdown
---
name: process-file
description: Process specified file
---

# Validate file argument

!`if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: File path is required"
  echo "Usage: /process-file <file-path>"
  exit 1
fi`

!`if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: File '$1' does not exist"
  exit 1
fi`

Processing file: $1
```

#### Type Validation

```markdown
---
name: set-port
description: Set application port
---

# Validate port number

!`if ! echo "$1" | grep -q '^[0-9]\+$'; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: Port must be a number"
  exit 1
fi`

!`if [ "$1" -lt 1 ] || [ "$1" -gt 65535 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: Port must be between 1 and 65535"
  exit 1
fi`

Setting port to: $1
```

### Error Recovery

```markdown
---
name: resilient-operation
description: Perform operation with retries
---

!`max_attempts=3
attempt=1

while [ $attempt -le $max_attempts ]; do
echo "Attempt $attempt of $max_attempts..."

if your-operation "$1"; then
echo "‚úÖ Operation successful on attempt $attempt"
break
else
echo "‚ùå Operation failed on attempt $attempt"

    if [ $attempt -eq $max_attempts ]; then
      echo "‚ùå All attempts failed"
      exit 1
    fi

    echo "Waiting 10 seconds before retry..."
    sleep 10
    attempt=$((attempt + 1))

fi
done`
```

---

## Integration with Cursor IDE

### File Context Awareness

Cursor commands automatically have access to project context and can reference files:

```markdown
---
name: analyze-current-file
description: Analyze currently active file
---

Analyzing current file context:

!`echo "Current working directory: $(pwd)"`
!`echo "Available files:"`
!`ls -la`

# Reference specific files

Current component: @src/components/App.tsx
Configuration: @package.json
Styles: @src/index.css
```

### IDE-Specific Features

Cursor provides IDE-specific context that commands can leverage:

```markdown
---
name: ide-info
description: Show IDE and project information
---

IDE and Project Information:

!`echo "Cursor IDE Information:"`
!`echo "Working Directory: $(pwd)"`
!`echo "Git Repository: $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo 'Not a git repo')"`
!`echo "Current Branch: $(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo 'Not on any branch')"`
!`echo "Node.js Project: $([ -f package.json ] && echo 'Yes' || echo 'No')"`
```

### Integration with Cursor's AI

Commands can provide context and guidance to Cursor's AI:

```markdown
---
name: code-review-setup
description: Setup code review context for AI
---

# Code Review Context

Please review the following code with focus on:

1. **Security**: Check for common vulnerabilities
2. **Performance**: Identify optimization opportunities
3. **Style**: Ensure consistency with project standards
4. **Testing**: Verify adequate test coverage

## Project Standards

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow functional programming patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Write comprehensive JSDoc comments

## Files to Review

@src/
@tests/

Please provide detailed feedback and suggestions for improvement.
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Argument Handling Mistakes

#### ‚ùå Bad: No argument validation

```markdown
---
name: deploy
---

!`kubectl apply -f $1`
```

#### ‚úÖ Good: Proper validation

```markdown
---
name: deploy
---

!`if [ -z "$1" ]; then
echo "‚ùå Error: Environment is required"
exit 1
fi

!`if [ ! -d "k8s/$1" ]; then
echo "‚ùå Error: Environment '$1' not found"
exit 1
fi

!`kubectl apply -f k8s/$1/`
```

### Rules Configuration Issues

#### ‚ùå Bad: Vague rules

```plaintext
# Be helpful and write good code
```

#### ‚úÖ Good: Specific, actionable rules

```plaintext
# React/TypeScript Project Standards

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow PascalCase for components
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## File Organization
- Components: src/components/
- Hooks: src/hooks/
- Utilities: src/utils/
- Types: src/types/

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: __tests__/ directories
- Integration tests: tests/integration/
- Minimum 80% code coverage
```

### Shell Command Issues

#### ‚ùå Bad: Unsafe operations

```markdown
---
name: cleanup
---

!`rm -rf $1`
```

#### ‚úÖ Good: Safe with validation

```markdown
---
name: cleanup
---

!`if [ -z "$1" ]; then
echo "‚ùå Error: Path is required"
exit 1
fi

!`if echo "$1" | grep -q "^[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]*$"; then
  rm -rf "$1"
  echo "‚úÖ Cleaned up: $1"
else
  echo "‚ùå Invalid path format: $1"
  exit 1
fi`
```

---

## Testing and Validation

### Command Testing

```markdown
---
name: test-deploy
description: Test deployment command
---

# Test Deployment Command

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Valid Environment

Command: /deploy production
Expected: ‚úÖ Successful deployment to production

### Test 2: Invalid Environment

Command: /deploy invalid
Expected: ‚ùå Error message about invalid environment

### Test 3: Missing Environment

Command: /deploy
Expected: ‚ùå Error message about required environment

## Test Execution

!`echo "Running deployment tests..."

# Test valid environment

echo "Test 1: Valid environment"
if echo "production" | grep -q "production\|staging\|development"; then
echo "‚úÖ Valid environment test passed"
else
echo "‚ùå Valid environment test failed"
fi

# Test invalid environment

echo "Test 2: Invalid environment"
if echo "invalid" | grep -q "production\|staging\|development"; then
echo "‚ùå Invalid environment test failed"
else
echo "‚úÖ Invalid environment test passed"
fi

echo "Deployment tests completed."`
```

### Rules Validation

Create test scenarios to validate your `.cursorrules`:

```plaintext
## Rules Validation Tests

### Test 1: Code Style Compliance
Test: Create a component without proper TypeScript types
Expected: AI should suggest adding proper types

### Test 2: File Organization
Test: Place utility function in component file
Expected: AI should suggest moving to utils/

### Test 3: Testing Requirements
Test: Commit code without tests
Expected: AI should remind about testing requirements
```

## Quick Reference

### Command Patterns

| Pattern         | Description          | Example                      |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `$1`, `$2`      | Positional arguments | `$1` ‚Üí "production"          |
| `$#`            | Number of arguments  | `$#` ‚Üí 2                     |
| `$@`            | All arguments        | `$@` ‚Üí "production" "v1.0.0" |
| `${1:-default}` | Default value        | `${1:-latest}` ‚Üí "latest"    |

### Validation Patterns

```bash
# Required argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: Argument required"
  exit 1
fi

# File exists
if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: File does not exist"
  exit 1
fi

# Choice validation
case "$1" in
  option1|option2|option3)
    echo "Valid choice"
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Invalid choice"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

# Number validation
if ! echo "$1" | grep -q '^[0-9]\+$'; then
  echo "Error: Must be a number"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Shell Command Patterns

| Pattern                        | Purpose               | Example                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `!`command``                   | Execute shell command | `!`git status``                 |
| `!`set -e``                    | Exit on error         | `!`set -e``                     |
| `!`if condition; then ... fi`` | Conditional logic     | `!`if [ -f "$1" ]; then ... fi` |
| `@file`                        | Include file content  | `@package.json`                 |
