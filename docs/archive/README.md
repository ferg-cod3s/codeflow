# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that was relevant during development but is no longer needed in the active codebase context.

## Structure

- `plans/` - Historical implementation plans
- `research/` - Historical research and analysis
- `audits/` - Code audits and best practice reviews
- `snapshots/` - Point-in-time documentation snapshots

## Purpose

Files are preserved for historical reference but excluded from AI context to maintain clean, relevant documentation. This prevents outdated information from polluting the current development context while preserving the project's development history.

## Archive Date

Archived on: January 2025

- **Research**: 26 research documents from `docs/research/`
