# Agent Upgrade Implementation Plan for CodeFlow

## Overview

Agent upgrades in CodeFlow are essential for maintaining a robust, extensible, and high-performing automation ecosystem. The upgrade process is guided by principles of a single source of truth, modular architecture, context management, orchestrator compatibility, and unified validation. This plan synthesizes available guidelines and best practices to deliver a ready-to-execute strategy for agent upgrades, referencing all relevant architectural, research, and planning documents.

## Current State Analysis

- Agents are defined in multiple formats and locations, leading to duplication and sync issues.
- Orchestrators and meta-agents coordinate agent handoff, but legacy agents may lack standardized interfaces and validation.
- Migration and registry refactor efforts are underway but require consolidation and schema compliance.
- Security, reliability, and context management standards are variably enforced across agents.

## Desired End State

- All agents consolidated in `codeflow-agents/` using the unified `BaseAgent` format.
- Agents expose standardized interfaces, support version negotiation, and advertise capabilities for dynamic orchestrator integration.
- Unified validation schema ensures consistency and simplifies migration.
- Seamless compatibility across platforms (Claude Code, OpenCode, MCP).
- Robust security, reliability, and context management enforced for all agents.

## Out-of-Scope Items

- Deep refactoring of orchestrator logic beyond agent interface updates.
- Migration of legacy agents not currently in use or deprecated.
- Platform-specific enhancements outside the unified agent format.
- Non-agent workflow commands and tools.

## Implementation Approach

Follow a phased, test-driven, and validation-centric approach:

- Backup and consolidate agent files
- Enforce schema compliance and update agent definitions
- Regenerate output formats and validate round-trip conversion
- Update documentation and monitor MCP server registration
- Run comprehensive test suites and performance benchmarks

## Phased Breakdown

### Phase 1: Preparation & Backup

- Backup all agent files in current and legacy locations
- Document current agent inventory and formats

### Phase 2: Consolidation & Schema Compliance

- Move all agents to `codeflow-agents/`
- Update agent files to comply with `BaseAgent` schema (name, description, mode, tools, etc.)
- Remove deprecated or duplicate agents

### Phase 3: Validation & Conversion

- Run `codeflow validate` to ensure schema compliance
- Use `codeflow convert-all` to generate Claude Code and OpenCode formats
- Test round-trip conversion for data integrity
- Address all validation warnings/errors

### Phase 4: Documentation & Registry Update

- Update documentation in DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md
- Monitor MCP server for tool registration and compatibility
- Document upgrade process and lessons learned

### Phase 5: Testing & Performance Benchmarking

- Run full test suite (unit, integration, performance)
- Benchmark agent performance and context management
- Monitor for security, reliability, and compatibility issues

## Detailed Changes Per Phase

- **Phase 1:** Archive all agent files, create inventory spreadsheet, note legacy formats
- **Phase 2:** Edit agent files for schema compliance, consolidate to single directory, remove deprecated agents
- **Phase 3:** Validate agents, regenerate output formats, test conversion, fix errors
- **Phase 4:** Update documentation, monitor MCP server, record lessons learned
- **Phase 5:** Run and expand test suites, benchmark performance, monitor post-upgrade stability

## Automated and Manual Success Criteria

### Automated

- All agents pass `codeflow validate` with zero errors
- Output formats generated and pass round-trip conversion tests
- MCP server registers all agents and commands without issues
- Full test suite passes (unit, integration, performance)

### Manual

- Documentation updated and reviewed
- Upgrade process and lessons learned recorded
- No security, reliability, or compatibility issues post-upgrade
- Technical leads review and approve changes

## Testing Strategy

- Use comprehensive test suites for unit, integration, and performance testing
- Validate agent health, context management, and orchestrator handoff
- Monitor MCP server for registration and compatibility
- Perform manual review of documentation and upgrade process

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize context bloat via hierarchical context, selective filtering, and progressive loading
- Benchmark agent and orchestrator performance before and after upgrade
- Monitor for regressions and optimize as needed

## Migration Notes

- Always backup agent files before migration
- Use single source of truth for agent definitions
- Validate and test agents after migration
- Document changes and update architectural diagrams
- Collaborate with orchestrator and meta-agents for complex upgrades
