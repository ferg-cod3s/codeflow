# Slash Commands Guide

This document explains the slash commands available in the codeflow workflow system for both Claude Code and OpenCode platforms.

## Setup Commands

### `codeflow setup`

**Purpose**: Install all agents and commands to your project
**Usage**: `codeflow setup [project-path]`
**Options**:

- `--type claude-code`: Install for Claude Code (.claude/commands)
- `--type opencode`: Install for OpenCode (.opencode/command)
- `--global`: Install to global directories
- `--force`: Force overwrite existing setup

**Examples**:

```bash
codeflow setup .                    # Setup current directory
codeflow setup --type opencode      # Setup for OpenCode
codeflow setup --type claude-code   # Setup for Claude Code

### MCP-Compatible Clients (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)

MCP clients use JSON parameter format for tool calls:

```json
{
  "tool": "research",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "Research question or topic",
    "scope": "codebase|research|both",
    "depth": "shallow|medium|deep",
    "ticket": "path/to/ticket.md"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Research Command

```bash
# Claude Code
/research research/tickets/feature-auth.md
/research "investigate user authentication system" --scope=codebase --depth=deep

# OpenCode
/research "investigate user authentication system for OAuth integration"

# MCP Client (JSON format)
{
  "tool": "research",
  "parameters": {
    "query": "investigate user authentication system",
    "scope": "codebase",
    "depth": "deep"
  }
}
```

### Planning Command

```bash
# Both platforms
/plan research/tickets/feature-auth.md research/research/2025-01-15_auth-research.md
```

### Execution Command

```bash
# Both platforms
/execute research/plans/oauth-integration-plan.md
```

### Test Command

```bash
# Both platforms
/test research/plans/oauth-integration-plan.md
/test "user authentication system with OAuth integration"
```

````

````

## Agent Integration

Commands automatically select appropriate specialized agents:

**Research Phase Agents**:

- `codebase-locator` - Find WHERE components exist
- `codebase-analyzer` - Understand HOW code works
- `research-locator` - Discover existing documentation
- `operations_incident_commander` - For operational issues
- `development_migrations_specialist` - For database changes
- `programmatic_seo_engineer` - For SEO architecture
- `content_localization_coordinator` - For i18n workflows
- `quality-testing_performance_tester` - For performance analysis

**Planning & Execution**:

- Uses domain-appropriate agents based on implementation scope
- Follows agent handoff patterns for complex scenarios
- Respects model tier routing (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514 for strategy, claude-sonnet-4-20250514 for technical work)

## Installation & Management

### Install Commands to Project

```bash
# Copy all agents and commands to project
codeflow sync --project ~/path/to/project

# Check sync status
codeflow status ~/path/to/project
````

### Directory Structure After Installation

│       ├── plan.md
│       ├── execute.md

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the Complete Workflow Order**: research → plan → execute → test → document → commit → review
2. **Use Appropriate Models**: Research & documentation use anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514, technical work uses claude-sonnet-4-20250514
3. **Run Fresh Research**: Always start with current codebase analysis
4. **Test Before Committing**: Generate comprehensive tests to prevent regressions
5. **Document Everything**: Create user guides and technical docs for maintainability
6. **Validate Success Criteria**: Complete both automated and manual checks
7. **Review Before Finalizing**: Use `/review` to validate implementation quality

## Troubleshooting

**Commands Not Found**: Run `codeflow sync --project` to install commands to your project
**Agent Errors**: Check that agents are properly installed with `codeflow status`
**Model Access**: Ensure you have access to the required models (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514, claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
**Permission Issues**: Verify write access to project directories

## Extending Commands

To create custom commands:

1. Add `.md` files to `.claude/commands/` or `.opencode/command/`
2. Use proper YAML frontmatter format for each platform
3. Include `{{variable}}` placeholder for user input
4. Test with `codeflow commands` to verify recognition
